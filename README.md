# xkoko

An X11 program that shows a single drawing of my fursona, as an additional bonus to this art:

![artwork of my fursona entering through a window on a twm setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kokoscript/xkoko/main/koko-twm.png)

The "outside the window" effect is implemented, but will not use your WM's borders; the twm window from the art is used instead.
